# SimpleCRUD Flutter Application

A basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Flutter app that interacts with a REST API for managing items. The app follows clean architecture principles with proper state management using Cubit from the Bloc package.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Flutter installed. You can follow the [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) if you havenâ€™t already done so.

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/physicx101/simplecrud.git
    cd simplecrud
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Run this command to install all necessary packages:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Run the app:**

   Connect an emulator or a physical device, and run the app by executing:

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Project Architecture

The app follows Clean Architecture and is structured into three main layers:

- **Data Layer**:
    - Handles API calls using Dio.
    - Contains models for mapping API responses (e.g., `ItemModel`).
    - Communicates with the REST API via services (e.g., `ItemApiService`).

- **Domain Layer**:
    - Contains core business logic.
    - Defines entities and use cases (e.g., `FetchItem`, `CreateItem`, etc.).

- **Presentation Layer**:
    - Manages UI and state.
    - Uses Cubit for state management, with separate states for loading, success, and error.
    - Contains widgets and screens for displaying the list of items, item details, and forms for item creation/updating.

## Key Features

- **Create** items with form inputs.
- **Read** items from the API and display them in a list.
- **Update** items via the UI.
- **Delete** items from the API or locally.
